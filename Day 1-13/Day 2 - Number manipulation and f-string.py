Introducing attributes:
    
    string: Normal text, like the one we use in our print() function.
            always concatenated between ""
    int: Entire numbers, or -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and so on. No decimals
    float: Floating point number. Now we enter the world of decimals!
            3.1416 or Pi is a float
    boolean: True or false. It is as easy as it can get.
    
Attributes can be converted between each other, be it a user-created function
or basic functions like "len()". len() only accepts a container, or string,
counting the total of characters of this container and returning a result
with attribute int. That's why len() returns an exception (error) when 
you input an int. "123" is treated like a string, not an int, opposed to 
123. Common convertion functions:
    int() = String to integer
    str() = int to string
    float() = String to float
    type() = 
    
type() can also be used to check the attribute of a container
    
Strings can be used with "subscripts". That means, a value of my 
whole string to be printed. For example, the word "Hello", where H is 
the subscript 0, and O is the subscript 4. Programation Languages always 
start counting from 0, so it's pretty important to take that into account.

A number written like 123_456_789 = 123456789.

Arithmetic Operators:
    Addition = +
    Subtraction = -
    Multiplication = *
    Division = / (float result)
    Division = // (int result)
    Power = **
    
    Further manipulation of variables: 
    += : Adds the specified value (after =) to the variable (before +)
    This can be used with -, *, /, **. Useful for modifying variables in
    conditionals or functions.
    
f-string:
    We can mix variables with different attributes without converting:
    score = 0
    height = 1.8
    isWinning  = True
    print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {height}, and are you winning? {isWinning}")
